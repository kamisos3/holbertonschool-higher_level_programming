▶ **Overview**

The JavaScript Warmup project contains a series of exercises that cover the basics of JavaScript programming. Each source file demonstrates a specific concept, such as printing output to the console, working with variables, using loops and conditionals, and defining functions. These installments are intended to build a strong foundation for further study in JavaScript and front-end development.


▶ **Concepts**

- **console.log()**  
  Prints output to the console, useful for debugging and displaying results.

- **let, const, var**  
  Used to declare variables. `let` and `const` are block-scoped, while `var` is function-scoped.

- **typeof**  
  Returns the data type of a variable.

- **if/else statements**  
  Used for conditional logic to execute code based on certain conditions.

- **for loops**  
  Allows repeated execution of a block of code.

- **function declarations**  
  Defines reusable blocks of code that can take parameters and return values.

- **process.argv**  
  Accesses command-line arguments passed to a Node.js script.


▶ **Example**

Here is a simple JavaScript exercise example from the project:

```javascript

const myVar = 'JavaScript is amazing';
console.log(myVar);

```
